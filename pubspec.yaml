  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
    - assets/
  #   - images/a_dot_ham.jpeg

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
    - family: RobotoBOLD
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/RobotoCondensed-Bold.ttf

    - family: RobotoBOLDItalic
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/RobotoCondensed-BoldItalic.ttf

    - family: RobotoItalic
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/RobotoCondensed-Italic.ttf

    - family: RobotoLight
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/RobotoCondensed-Light.ttf

    - family: RobotoRegular
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/RobotoCondensed-Regular.ttf

  #         style: italic
  #   - family: Trajan Pro
  #     fonts:
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro_Bold.ttf
  #         weight: 700
